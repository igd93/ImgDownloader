The built program reads the file, given as a command line argument and retrieves the images from the urls in that file.
I used flake 8 Linter as a Styling Guide.
Unit tests are located in the tests_img_downloader.py file. 
The example file images.txt contains links to the images from pandas website.
There is a requirements.txt for the library validators in the unittest section, we check the validity of read links.
